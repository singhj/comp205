    "This case study is based on the [7th World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2019/). The first was released in April 2012 in support of a UN High level meeting on “Wellbeing and Happiness: Defining a New Economic Paradigm”. That 2012 report presented the available global data on national happiness and reviewed related evidence from the emerging science of happiness, showing that the quality of people’s lives can be coherently, reliably, and validly assessed by a variety of subjective well-being measures, collectively referred to then and in subsequent reports as “happiness.” \n",
    "\n",
    "This year’s World Happiness Report focuses on happiness and the community: how happiness has evolved over the past dozen years, with a focus on the technologies, social norms, conflicts and government policies that have driven those changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have downloaded the data from [Chapter 2: Online Data](https://s3.amazonaws.com/happiness-report/2019/Chapter2OnlineData.xls) and filtered out data prior to 2018. The result is available in CSV format, as the file `happiness-report.csv`. _Data Prep Notes:_ The Happiness Score column is from Figure 2.6 in the downloaded report; the other data columns are from Table 2.1 in the same report. If a country wasn't in either list, it wasn't included in the CSV file."
