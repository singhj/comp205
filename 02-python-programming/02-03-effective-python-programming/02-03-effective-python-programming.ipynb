    "# Effective python programming\n",

    "   1. Return to code after a long absence and know what you did. \n",
    "   2. Allow others to reuse your code and/or repeat your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Data Science, reusability and repeatability are more important than the regular software engineering goal of \"maintainability\", but the rules for \"reusability\" are identical to those for \"maintainability\"! \n",
    "# The elements of style\n",
    "There are a number of rules that affect python readability and reusability. Fortunately, there are automated tools for checking Python style in Jupyter. You must turn them on, however. \n",

    "2. Gratuitous comments that don't aid understanding of code. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Enough detail\n",
