    "# Part 2: what is effective commenting? \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several basic principles of commenting that apply to all programming, and not just Python. \n",
    "1. *Why* and not just *what*. \n",
    "2. Enough detail for other non-authors to understand your program. \n",
    "3. Top-level comments read like a document outline of what was done.\n",
    "\n",
    "# *Why* and not *what*\n",
    "Many novices tend toward commenting about what the language is doing rather than why they did specific things. We'll study later what comments should entail. For now, let's concentrate on what comments should *not* contain:\n",
    "1. A description in English of the code. \n",
    "2. Gratuitous comments that don't aid understanding of code. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Enough detail\n",
    "I often tell students that \"bugs are not in the code; they're in the comments.\" The comments are where you make your assumptions clear, and explain why the program should work. This includes anything that might not be obvious to a casual observer. \n",
    "\n",
    "# A document outline\n",
    "It's best if the comments look like a document that can explain the program well. This cannot always be accomplished but it makes for the best user reading experience. \n",
